# Responsible-Human-Centred-RL-Design
Coursework submitted for COMP6247 Reinforcement Learning Literatue Review, MEng/MSc module


**Abstract:**

*In human-cerntric reinforcement learning (HCRL), applied technologies acts only as a substrate to some interdisciplinary dilemma, yet research often neglects the non-technical aspects of either a problem or its solutions. This is evidenced by novel research into responsible HCRL design, which outlines flaws in current technologies surrounding the lack of explainability, intepretability and transparency criteria. By analysing both the criticisms and technology we delineate a set of principles which instruct responsible design. We further evaluate a varied sample of recent HCRL research against the criteria to provide insight into characteristics which drive responsible/not so responsible system design. Conclusively, we provide educated suggestions towards improving particular aspects of research which can be generally applied.*
